# withdrive

Project repository for the withdrive project.

This was done as part of my semester long project.

The back-end rest service is developed using Java & Spring Boot and dependencies are managed using Gradle. The frontend was made with React.
A main focus of the semester was learning the basics of web-security, and the need for extensive testing (unit, API, frontend and end to end tests).
The project also worked with the Gitlab CI/CD to ensure working code and continious delivery to docker.
