# withdrive

Project repository for the withdrive project. Withdrive is an car-pooling platform that can be used by drivers and passengers alike.

This was done as part of my semester long project.

The back-end RESTFUL service is developed using Java & Spring Boot and dependencies are managed using Gradle. The frontend was made with React.
A main focus of the semester was learning the basics of web-security, and understanding the need for extensive testing which included; unit, API, frontend and end to end tests.

The project also worked with the Gitlab CI/CD to ensure working code and continious delivery to Docker.
